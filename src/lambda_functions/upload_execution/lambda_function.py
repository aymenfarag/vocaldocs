AWS Lambda function for handling document uploads.

This module processes document uploads from users, stores the files in S3,
and creates corresponding entries in DynamoDB to track the processing status.
It handles file metadata, user information, and sets up the document for
further processing in the VocalDocs workflow.

    AWS Lambda function handler for processing document uploads.

    This function handles the upload of documents to the VocalDocs system.
    It performs the following operations:
    1. Extracts document metadata and content from the event
    2. Decodes the base64-encoded file content
    3. Generates a unique reference key for the document
    4. Uploads the document to S3
    5. Creates a record in DynamoDB with metadata and processing status
    6. Sets a TTL for automatic cleanup after one week

    Args:
        event (dict): The event data containing document information and content
        _: Unused Lambda context parameter

    Returns:
        dict: A response object with statusCode and body containing confirmation
              message and reference key, or an error message
